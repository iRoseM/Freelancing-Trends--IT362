It all began in the dynamic world of Sales & Business Development, where I learned to navigate the complexities of full-cycle sales strategies. From the art of the perfect pitch to the intricacies of risk management, I mastered the skills needed to drive success.

My love for storytelling naturally led me into the realm of writing. I've authored fiction and non-fiction books that bring stories to life, and I've mastered the craft of SEO-optimized blogs, engaging articles, and persuasive sales copy. Every piece is a narrative designed to captivate, inform, and convert. This storytelling ability extends into the world of research writing as well. Over the years, I’ve penned research papers, proposals, questionnaires, case studies, journals, theses, and dissertations, helping clients transform complex ideas into impactful academic contributions. Whether it's a project report or a presentation, I ensure every detail resonates with its audience.

Leading my own Business Consultancy for over a decade has been another chapter in my journey. With a diverse industry background, I’ve not only set up numerous businesses but also propelled them to new heights. By optimizing strategies, conducting thorough market research, and crafting clear, compelling business plans, I’ve helped clients navigate the challenging waters of entrepreneurship. Whether it’s a startup or an established company, my tailored solutions drive expansion, attract funding, and build strong personal brands.

As the world went digital, so did I. Embracing digital marketing became essential, and I dove into it headfirst. From Wikipedia editing to ensure an authoritative digital footprint, to leveraging social media marketing, SEO, email campaigns, and Google Ads, I’ve expanded businesses' reach online. Helping clients thrive in the digital space has been a thrilling part of my journey.

So here’s the thing—you’ve got the big idea. The Oscar-worthy, New York Times-bestselling premise for an incredible story.

In case you haven’t noticed already, I’m a writer. And not just any writer—the kind who thrives on turning your vision into moving, authentic words. Whether your starting point is a one-liner, a rough outline, a YouTube video, or even a Taylor Swift song, I can craft it into a compelling, polished piece.

I specialize in:
✍️ Content Writing & Blogging – Engaging, SEO-friendly, and audience-driven.
? Fiction & Storytelling – Expert world-building, character development, and immersive narratives.
? LARP & RPG Writing – Bringing interactive stories to life with depth and intrigue.
? Editing & Proofreading – Ensuring clarity, coherence, and perfection.

I don’t just write—I research. I dive deep into your subject matter and your personal style to make sure your message hits home with your target audience. My process is collaborative, flexible, and focused on making sure you’re beyond satisfied with the final product. Revisions? No problem. I care about getting it right just as much as you do.

A little about me:
I hold a degree in English and Literary Studies and am currently working on my master’s in English Literature. My work has been widely published in online blogs and anthologies, and in 2021, I was longlisted for a well-known writing prize in Africa. Since 2020, I’ve worked as a freelance writer with small agencies, honing my craft under pressure while staying disciplined, motivated, and always passionate.

I'm Umair, a results-driven SEO and content writing specialist with a deep passion for helping businesses climb the digital ladder. With 13+ years in the industry, I've honed my skills to create SEO content that not only engages but also ranks high on search engines.
 
My clients come from a vast range of industries: healthcare, tech, finance, entertainment, real estate, FinTech, Education, and more. For these clients, I have written blogs, articles, website content, reviews, product descriptions, eBooks, whitepapers, PRs, product listings, and much more. 

Being in the industry for 14 years, I have learned to use a variety of SEO, writing, and project management tools. Therefore, I have a good understanding of WordPress, Yoast SEO, Grammarly, Copyscape, NeuronWriter, SurferSEO, and many others. 

If you’re looking for a blog writer, article writer, eBook writer, website content writer, copywriter, or social media post writer, your search ends here.

What Do I Bring to the Table?
I bring VALUE! I turn conversations into conversions. 

Here’s a little more about my services.

◙ Article/Blog Writing

I write well-researched pieces that include links to credible sources so your readers know they aren’t reading fake or made-up information. And for blogs, I always write in a friendly tone that engages users.

◙ Website Content Writing

I’ll read about your business, understand your brand, perform an analysis of your competitors, and then craft compelling copy that builds trust between you and your website visitors. 

◙ Product Description Writing

The product descriptions I write have proper keywords included in them. Rest assured I have written hundreds of Amazon and Shopify listings. I know how to give your product the right title, how to convert features to benefits, and the very purpose of including bullet points in product descriptions. 

◙ SEO Content Writing

Sometimes, you need certain blogs written to get some traction on SERPs. At times, you’re looking to refresh old content to make it perform better on search engines. I can add meta titles, descriptions, images, alt tags, primary keywords, secondary keywords, LSI keywords, internal links, and external links to your blogs so they rank better in search results. 

◙ ""STRICTLY NO AI"" ◙

I have great confidence in my research and writing skills. I create content from scratch and don’t condone the idea of “I just use AI for research purposes” at all. 

I hope this was enough to convince you. Let’s discuss your project without delay. Message me!

As the web evolved in the late '90s, I grew alongside it, constantly learning and honing my skills. I later pursued a degree in Law at the University of Michigan while continuing to expand my business and technology knowledge through late-night coding sessions. From the beginning of my career, I have been primarily focused on the Microsoft stack. I started with classic ASP and quickly became an evangelist for the then-emerging .Net Framework for the US Department of Defense in 2000. Since then, I have made it a priority to stay on the cutting edge of technology, with a keen interest in ASP.Net Core 3, which I wrote about on the day of its release. Feel free to contact me, and I'll gladly share my insights.

In 1997, I began my consulting career, collaborating with esteemed organizations such as the US Department of Defense, SC Department of Transportation, eBay, State Farm Insurance, Verizon, GTE, Sterilite, and more. In 2005, I established coderPro.net and currently split my time between Chicago, Ecuador, and Prague, depending on the occasion.

 As a globetrotting entrepreneur, I continue to lead and expand coderPro.net while frequently traveling to meet clients worldwide. Despite the digital age, I firmly believe that business is still about personally building and nurturing relationships. In 2018, I ventured into technical writing and blogging, contributing to the blogs of several renowned companies, and I am currently working on my first book.

""It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows, in the end, the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.""

✅ In addition to data entry work, I try to do more different types of work
✅ Diploma in Electrical Engineering

NOTE:
I'm a full-time freelancer. But check my profile before you hire me and know that first what kind of work I do.

I started working on data entry in locally 2013. I first started the simple copy-paste work of data entry. Then I start working with different web research such as collecting company details or contact information. 

While working with data entry or web research I learned a lot about excel and I do a lot of work with excel and still do. 

I convert data from PDF to WORD and from PDF to EXCEL and I have done a lot of PDF related work. If you want you can check the reviews of my work.

After working on various projects locally for many years, I joined this marketplace in 2020. Then I started working in this marketplace. In this marketplace, I have completed 300+ projects with a 5star review.  But locally I have completed more projects with different clients

BTW, I do data entry as well as web scraping. Even I have completed many web scraping projects. However, I like to work honestly, so I check the site first, if I can scrape, then I scrape, otherwise, I do not. I don't do what I can't. Your precious time is the most priority to me.

I do any kind of product upload according to the instructions of the client. I uploaded the product on WordPress, Shopify and more platforms and still do. 

In addition to product upload, I do any other type of upload according to the instructions of the client.

Of course, I try to do any kind of work except data entry, web search or web scraping.

IMPORTANT:
Be sure to discuss the project details with me before you hire me and if everything goes well after the discussion then you will hire me. Because I like to work honestly. less"

My most experienced specialization is full cycle of books & magazines design, layout and prepress. For my 20+ years career, I made lots of magazines. Some of them — from scratch, in other cases I joined existing teams.

Yet not only magazines, but everything that could be printed. I made brochures, calendars, booklets, leaflets, posters, etc. in the number of plenty. Also I designed packages for various products. And many species of clothing prints.

A couple years I worked as prepress engineer in printing house, that made my understanding of printing processes much deeper.

Another specialization of mine is photo editing and retouching. It started as part of print production and ended up (well, not yet ended) with me as Photoshop teacher at photo school. I have been fortunate to work with very meticulous photographers on very complex projects.

Sometimes as part of photo manipulations and sometimes as part of digital illustration, I have some experience in 3D graphic and AI generated visuals.

As world become more digital, my curiosity leaded me to another side of graphic design, where printing is not that important. So, motion design, web design and UI/UX was added to my competencies.
